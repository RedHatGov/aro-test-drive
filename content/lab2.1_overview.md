# Overview

Let's deploy a real workload on ARO.  You will use this [Highly Available Web Application Demo for Azure][1] created by our [Chief Architect][2].

Here is an image of the architecture from the demo repository:

You will deploy the modern web application components of this architecture.  Additionally, you will deploy an update to the modern web app's API using the [Ploigos Software Factory][3].
